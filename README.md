## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I used the lette rspacing style for the efirst time, it definitely made the site look better. I also got a bit better at structuring the html first before diving into the css, I think this made my workflow a bit faster and my code much cleaner, I will try to continue this in the future.


### Continued development

I would like to improve my overall know-how when adding images into a website, I do have the general jist of it, as this is not my first project although it is the first I have uploaded, but I honestly still get a little frightened and/or confused when it get's to that part. i also want to get a bit better at sussing out exactly which display type should be used for an element, if it is needed. I did not have to use the display style in this project, but it is something that I would like to work on.
